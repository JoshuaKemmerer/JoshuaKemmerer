<h4 align="center" style="font-style: italic">"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.

## About Me

I have been a developer for the past 10 years since I started working on my B.S. in Computer Science at BCCC and then Drexel University. I had two six-month long internships during my educational period, for both a small toy-manufacturing company and a financial technology company. I started my post-grad employment with the Phillies baseball team, developed over 10 apps, and introduced myself to both Azure and AWS. In late 2019, a recruiter contacted me seeking an Angular developer, and I then helped to convert a legacy Web app for an S&P 100 company. Then I started another contract for a consulting firm, CapTech Ventures, to develop full-stack for a Workers' compensation app.
